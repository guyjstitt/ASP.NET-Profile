			<h1>Explanation of HotDog Homework</h1>
			<p>First of all, I tried using a database to hold the data I wanted to display. Everything was fine locally until I deployed live. 
			When I first started the assignment, I sat down and began planning what I wanted to do. After looking at the assignment, I determined that
			there would be a many to many relationship between the user and the hotdogs. After taking around 10 minutes to set up the wireframe, I then 
			started trying to figure out to set up a many to many relationship with Entity in a code first implementation. I honestly learned a lot, even though I didnt get it to work. I stopped trying because I felt that I was spending too much time trying to figure it out. Once I pushed it live, I wasn't able to get my changes to load. I figured it was because no database existed. </p>
