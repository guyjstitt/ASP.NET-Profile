				<h1>Explanation of HotDog Homework</h1>
				<p style="color:white;">First of all, I tried using a database to hold the data I wanted to display. Everything was fine locally until I deployed live. 
				When I first started the assignment, I sat down and began planning what I wanted to do. After looking at the assignment, I determined that
				there would be a many to many relationship between the user and the hotdogs. After taking around 10 minutes to set up the wireframe, I then 
				started trying to figure out to set up a many to many relationship with Entity in a code first implementation. I honestly learned a lot, even though I didnt get it to work. I stopped trying because I felt that I was spending too much time trying to figure it out. Once I pushed it live, I wasn't able to get my changes to load. I figured it was because no database existed. </p>
				<br></br>
				<p style="color:white;"> I spend some time learning how to add the database and then correctly add the connection string. Of course, I had trouble getting the connection string to work. After some trial and error, I was able to get the live site to connect to the database. However, there was an issue with adding items to the database. So I went to the controller to figure out what the issue was. I then saw that I had defined the database context, but I had not defined it in the connection string. After I added the correct name value to the connection string, I was able to store data in the database in live. I don't have much time to work on the css for the wireframe, but I think that is unimportant right now. At least I know how to set up a database and connect to it now.
